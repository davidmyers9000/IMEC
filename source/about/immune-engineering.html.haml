%p 
  %strong Immune Engineering 
  is a set of tools and technologies to modulate the immune system.

%p Immune engineering is a rapidly growing field that merges engineering techniques with basic and translational immunology to generate innovative solutions to treat cancer, infectious disease, immunological disorders and major injuries. 
%p The two main fields that form the foundation of Immune Engineering are <a href="https://biomaterials.org/sigs-and-committees-sigs-and-committees-overview/immune-engineering">Biomaterials</a> and <a href="../cell-and-gene-therapy">Cell & Gene Therapy</a>.


%h5 Examples of Immune Engineering Approaches
%ul
  %li Manipulated immune cells as therapeutics (e.g. CAR T cells)
  %li Nanoparticle vaccines (e.g. the Pfizer and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines)
  %li Biomaterials that direct immune cells to behave certain ways upon implantation or injection (e.g. regenerative implants)
