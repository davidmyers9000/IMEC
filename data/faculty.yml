  bio: |
    Kara received her bachelor's and master's degrees in biomedical engineering from Drexel University in 2007. She conducted her doctoral research in the design of semi-degradable hydrogels for the repair of articular cartilage in the Biomaterials and Drug Delivery Laboratory at Drexel and in the Shanghai Key Tissue Engineering Laboratory of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. After completing her PhD in 2010, when she received the award for Most Outstanding Doctoral Graduate: Most Promise to Enhance Drexel's Reputation, she conducted research in the design of scaffolds for bone tissue engineering as a Fulbright Fellow in the Biomaterials, Biodegradables, and Biomimetics (the 3Bs) Research Group at the University of Minho in Guimaraes, Portugal. She is currently conducting research in the design of immunomodularatory biomaterials, particularly for bone tissue engineering. Her research interests include cell-biomaterial interactionns, biomaterial design, and international engineering education.

  bio: |
    Dr. Christopher B. Rodell is an Assistant Professor in the School of Biomedical Engineering, Health and Science Systems at Drexel University. Chris received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Tulane University as part of the historic ‘Katrina Class’ of 2009. He went on to conduct his doctoral research at the University of Pennsylvania, working on the development and in vivo application of injectable supramolecular hydrogels. Following completion of his PhD, Chris was a postdoctoral scholar with the Center for Systems Biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, exploring drug delivery platforms for innate immune activation and their applications toward cancer immunotherapy. To date, Chris has authored more than 40 peer-reviewed publications, 3 patent applications, and is the recipient of a number of awards, including an American Heart Association Predoctoral Fellowship, a Materials Research Society Gold Award, and the Solomon R. Pollack Award for excellence in graduate biomedical engineering research from the University of Pennsylvania, and a Hartwell Individual Biomedical Research Award.

  bio: Research in the Gaskill Lab examines the impact of drug abuse on the development of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND), focusing on dopamine-mediated changes in HIV infection in macrophages and on macrophage immune function. Our work has shown that dopamine increases the susceptibility of macrophages to HIV infection, at least in part through interaction with the endogenous macrophage dopaminergic system.
